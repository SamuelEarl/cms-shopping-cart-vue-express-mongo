// IMPORTANT NOTE:
// There is no need to manually check the user's auth status with every request or refresh their
// "isAuthenticated" or "scope" variables (which are stored in the browser) with every request. Each
// request that goes to the server will package up the cookie that was set when the user logged in.
// We already configured our routes on the server to check for authentication and scope, so our app
// is secure. It doesn't matter if a malicious user tampers with their cookie or their
// "isAuthenticated" or "scope" variables that are stored in the browser (in an attempt to gain
// access to things they are not allowed to) because everything is locked down on the server. For
// example, a malicious user could gain access to the admin pages if they set their
// "isAuthenticated" variable to true, but those pages would be blank. They wouldn't have access to
// see or alter the data, which is the most important thing.

// You can set a "requiresAuth: true" meta data property on each route that should be protected.
// For each protected route, check if the user is logged in before they are allowed access.
// If the user is not logged in, then redirect them to the login page.
