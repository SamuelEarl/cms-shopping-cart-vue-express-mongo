# I need to run "npm install" to install all dependencies, then "npm run build" (to create a production build in the /dist folder), then "npm prune --production" (to remove `devDependencies` packages) and then copy over only the node_modules directory (which contains the production-only packages) and the dist directory (which is the production build).

# TODO: I need to figure out what these instructions are doing. I thought they were installing dependencies in an intermediate Docker container and then copying over the necessary files and folders into the final Docker container. But if I delete the `dist` folder and try to run `make prod-rebuild` and then `make prod`, I get an error that says that Docker cannot find the `dist/server/server.js` module. So right now I have to first run `npm run build` outside of any Docker commands and then I can run `make prod-rebuild` and then `make prod` and everything works properly. Hmmm. I need all development and production build steps contained within the Dockerfiles and docker-compose files and contained within Docker containers so that they install the same package versions no matter what the host machine is. So I need to rework these files. I want to install and copy over fresh new `node_modules` and `dist` directies all from within my Docker files. I need to read up on multi-stage builds again.
